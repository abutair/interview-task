- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```

z-score -> numerical measurement that describes a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values .
for example if the mean of students group is 80 if any student have mark above the 80 the z-score will be postive 
, if student have mark less than 80 the z-score will be negtive and if the student have mark equal to the mean(average)
 the z-score will be equal 0 . 

min -max scaling ->  it's way to nomalize the input features(variables) , all features (variables) become in range
of 0 and 1 


Why we use normalization methods -> because Variables
 that are measured at different scales do not contribute equally to the model fitting

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library? 
what is unit testing and why would we use it?
```
write your answer here
unit testing -> means testing the smaller units of your application, like classes and methods.
why using unit testing -> prove to yourself, and perhaps to the users / clients / customers, that your code works.
using junit5 -> brand new features, solving junit4 problems,simple migration,opportunity to contribute, future of jvm testing

The main issue was I got the task when I wasn't ready to take it, I was out of my  hometown when  
I got the email  notification  on my phone I couldn't get back home until sunday morning  (I got the task email thursday Jul 1, 2021, 10:31 AM)
I only had two days to solve that , and that was a disadvantage for me. 

I hope next time you will tell me earlier so i can manage my time. 
overall that was good task  for me I had fun solving it.
